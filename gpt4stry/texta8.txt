Sure, let's proceed with the implementation starting with the `InteractionModule`. This module will handle the interactions with the users and the LLMs. The `handle_user_interaction` method can be responsible for capturing user input and formatting it as a `Task`. Likewise `handle_llm_interaction` can be responsible for processing interactions from LLMs.

```python
# interaction.py

class InteractionModule:
    def __init__(self):
        # initialise user interface here
        pass

    def handle_user_interaction(self):
        # Capture user input and convert it into a Task
        input_data = self.get_user_input()  # Assuming this method gets user input
        task = self.format_to_task(input_data)  # Assuming this method formats input to Task
        return task

    def format_to_task(self, input_data):
        # Converts input data into a Task
        pass
    
    def handle_llm_interaction(self, interaction):
        # Process LLM interaction and send to appropriate LLMs
        pass
```

For `CoordinationModule`, the `synchronize_llms` method can utilize a comparison mechanism to check if all the LLMs have the same version of the data. 

```python
# coordination.py

class CoordinationModule:
    def __init__(self):
        self.llms = []  # List of LLMs

    def distribute_task(self, task):
        for llm in self.llms:
            llm.assign_task(task)  # Assuming `assign_task` method exists in LLM class

    def synchronize_llms(self):
        # Ensures all LLMs are in sync 
        common_data = self.compare_llm_data()  # Assuming this method compares data among LLMs
        if not common_data:
            self.update_llms_data()  # Assuming this method updates data for all LLMs
```

In `LearningModule`, the `adapt_behavior` method can be responsible for implementing the learning logic. Based on the feedback from the tasks performed by the LLMs, this method can adjust the behavior of each LLM.

```python
# learning.py

class LearningModule:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def adapt_behavior(self, feedback):
        # Adjust LLM behavior based on feedback
        updated_behavior = self.analyze_feedback(feedback) # Assuming this method analyzes feedback
        self.apply_behavior(updated_behavior)  # Assuming this method applies updated behavior to all LLMs
```

Now these classes are starting to take shape, we still need to modify them as we move forward and get more understanding of our requirements. We also need class to represent an LLM and its behavior. Let's add more code to the methods as we develop our application further.
