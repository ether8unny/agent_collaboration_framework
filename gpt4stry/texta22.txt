Absolutely, let's proceed with writing the code. Building upon our conversation about the main modules, let's start coding the `LLM` class and the `Task` class, which are the building blocks of this framework.

Firstly, the `LLM` class (which stands for Language Learning Machine) should contain methods to get and update behavior and data. Let's say that our LLMs' behavior is rated on a scale from 1 to 10, and data is a dictionary containing the task. Here is how the `LLM` class could look like:

```python
# llm.py

class LLM:
    def __init__(self, behavior: int):
        self.behavior = behavior
        self.data = {}

    def get_behavior(self):
        return self.behavior

    def update_behavior(self, behavior: int):
        self.behavior = behavior

    def get_data(self):
        return self.data

    def update_data(self, data):
        self.data = data
```
Now let's create the `Task` class. A `Task` will have a description and a difficulty, let's represent difficulty as integer from 1 to 100. We'll use Python's dataclass module for brevity:

```python
# task.py
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Task:
    description: str
    difficulty: int
```
Next, we'll develop the `LearningModule`, `CoordinationModule`, and `InteractionModule` classes as discussed. For now, we will just define the skeleton of the methods with pass statement. In the next step, we'll implement these methods' functionalities.

```python
# learning.py 
class LearningModule:
    def __init__(self, llms) -> None:
        self.llms = llms

    def adapt_behavior(self, feedback):
        pass

    def _update_behavior(self, llm, feedback):
        pass

    def analyze_feedback(self, current_behavior, feedback):
        pass

# coordination.py
class CoordinationModule:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    
    def distribute_task(self, task):
        pass

    def _update_llm_data(self, llm, new_data):
        pass

# interaction.py
class InteractionModule:
    def __init__(self, learning_module):
        self.learning_module = learning_module

    def receive_task(self, task, feedback):
        pass
```
The next step is to define the functionalities of the methods in `LearningModule`, `CoordinationModule`, and `InteractionModule` based on the specification, and loop these methods to make multiple tasks and user feedbacks be handled. The system should be flexible to allow multiple users to provide tasks and feedback to the system. This involves integrating a proper user interface and tracking system to handle the user identification and their respective tasks and feedbacks. Then, we can start testing and debugging. The whole process should be iterative to continuously refine the framework. Are you ready? Let's move forward!
