Sounds great Arvid, let's start writing the code! But before doing that, let's consider some alternative structures and approaches for our framework. Evaluating these alternatives will help us in creating a robust, scalable and well-designed application.

## Approach 1: Explicit Module-Based Structure

In your suggested approach, we're making each major functionality (interaction, coordination, learning) into a separate module. This approach is clean and easy to understand. Importantly, it neatly abstracts each functionality. Here's a potential con for this approach: 

- *Code dependencies*: While modules separate logic well, they also have many dependencies between each other. This can make the actual flow of the code harder to understand and maintain.

Let's stick with the approach:

```python
# main.py
from interaction import InteractionModule
from coordination import CoordinationModule
from learning import LearningModule

class Main:
    def __init__(self):
        self.interaction_module = InteractionModule()
        self.coordination_module = CoordinationModule()
        self.learning_module = LearningModule()

    def run(self):
        # Initialize the workflow
        pass
```

We can start filling in some of the implementation details for these modules:

```python
# interaction.py

class InteractionModule:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def handle_user_interaction(self, interaction):
        # Process user interaction and send to appropriate LLMs
        pass

    def handle_llm_interaction(self, interaction):
        # Process LLM interaction and coordinate actions
        pass
```

```python
# coordination.py

class CoordinationModule:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def synchronize_llms(self):
        # Ensure all LLMs are in sync
        pass

    def distribute_task(self, task):
        # Distribute task among LLMs
        pass
```

```python
# learning.py

class LearningModule:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def adapt_behavior(self, feedback):
        # Adjust LLM behavior based on feedback
        pass
```
      
## Approach 2: Event-Driven Structure

In an alternative approach, we can follow an event-driven architecture. In this model, we'll have an event loop in our Main class, and each module will act as an event handler. This can provide better flexibility and scalability as adding new functionality is as easy as adding a new event handler.

Benefits:
- *Loose coupling*: The modules interact through events, and don't need to know specific details about each other.

Drawback:
- *Complexity*: An event-driven architecture can be harder to understand and debug due to its asynchronous nature.

Here's an example structure:

```python
# main.py
from interaction import InteractionModule
from coordination import CoordinationModule
from learning import LearningModule

class Main:
    def __init__(self):
        self.interaction_module = InteractionModule()
        self.coordination_module = CoordinationModule()
        self.learning_module = LearningModule()

    def event_loop(self):
        # Handle events and delegate to appropriate module
        pass
```

```python
# interaction.py

class InteractionModule:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def handle_event(self, event):
        # Process event and return results
        pass
```

```python
# coordination.py

class CoordinationModule:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def handle_event(self, event):
        # Process event and return results
        pass
```

```python
# learning.py

class LearningModule:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def handle_event(self, event):
        # Process event and return results
        pass
```
   
Let's think about which of these two approaches will work better given our project requirements or if there's a third option that's even more appropriate. After we finalize the structure, we can dive deeper into the implementation.
