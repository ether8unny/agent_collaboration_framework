Excellent, let's continue working on the code for the other components of the system. First, we need to establish a way for the LLMs to communicate and share information. Let's do this by creating a `CommunicationModule`. This module will allow the LLMs to share their current task status, problem-solving strategies, and any useful knowledge they've acquired.

Here's a basic structure for our `CommunicationModule`:

```python
# communication.py

class CommunicationModule:
    def __init__(self, llms):
        self.llms = llms

    def share_information(self):
        for llm in self.llms:
            llm_information = llm.get_information()
            self._disseminate_information(llm_information)

    def _disseminate_information(self, information):
        for llm in self.llms:
            llm.receive_information(information)
```

In this class, `share_information` goes through each LLM and gets its current information using `get_information`, then disseminates this information to all the other LLMs through `_disseminate_information`.

Now, let's add in the specific methods we've called within these classes to our `LLM` class:

```python
# llm.py

class LLM:
    def __init__(self, initial_behavior):
        self.behavior = initial_behavior
        self.information = {}

    def get_behavior(self):
        return self.behavior

    def update_behavior(self, updated_behavior):
        self.behavior = updated_behavior

    def get_information(self):
        return self.information

    def receive_information(self, information):
        self.information.update(information)

    def update_data(self, new_data)
       # This could represent any form of information or strategy update.
       self.information.update({'data': new_data})
```

These methods allow us to get the behavior and information of the LLM, update the behavior, and add new information to the LLM's stored data. We should now test and debug the code we've written, and see how well the LLMs can share and update information following the collaborative AI framework we've designed and coded.
