Sure, Alex. Let's dive into the coding part. Based on our discussions about the modules, I will start by laying out the basic structure of the codebase with appropriate files for each module. 

Here's what I have in mind:

- ```main.py```: This will serve as our application's entry point.
- ```interaction.py```: This will handle all interactions – both user interactions and interactions between different LLMs.
- ```coordination.py```: This will act as the hub for communication, synchronization, and coordination between the LLMs.
- ```learning.py```: This will deal with the adaptive learning aspects of our framework, allowing models to dynamically adjust their behavior based on task progress and user feedback.

Starting with the entrypoint file `main.py`:

```python
# main.py
from interaction import InteractionModule
from coordination import CoordinationModule
from learning import LearningModule

class Main:
    def __init__(self):
        self.interaction_module = InteractionModule()
        self.coordination_module = CoordinationModule()
        self.learning_module = LearningModule()
    
    def run(self):
        # Initialize the workflow
        pass
```

In the `InteractionModule`, `CoordinationModule`, and `LearningModule` classes, to begin with, we will have an initialization method. Further, we can define methods as per our requirements.

```python
# interaction.py

class InteractionModule:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
```
```python
# coordination.py

class CoordinationModule:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
```
```python
# learning.py

class LearningModule:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
```
We will be importing all the above modules into the 'EntryPoint' module for initializing them and managing the function calls. 

This is just a proposed outline and we will flesh the details out as we go along with the development. This approach ensures that we are logically grouping the related pieces of functionality and it also leaves us enough room to accommodate changes as we iterate and improve our application.

Let's discuss and refine this initial layout during our next correspondence.
