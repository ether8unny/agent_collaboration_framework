Agreed, let's start fleshing out the `LearningModule` with some basic functionality. In order to make this code functional, let's assume we have some `LLM` class with methods like `get_behavior` and `update_behavior`.

Here is the refactored `LearningModule`:

```python
# learning.py
from llm import LLM  # let's assume there exists a class 'LLM' representing a Local Learning Model

class LearningModule:
    def __init__(self):
        self.llms = [LLM() for _ in range(5)]  # Let's say we have 5 LLMs for now.

    def adapt_behavior(self, feedback):
        # Adjust LLM behavior based on feedback
        for llm in self.llms:
            current_behavior = llm.get_behavior()
            updated_behavior = self.analyze_feedback(current_behavior, feedback)
            llm.update_behavior(updated_behavior)

    def analyze_feedback(self, current_behavior, feedback):
        # A simple rule to analyze feedback
        # This needs to be replaced with more advanced learning algorithms
        return current_behavior * (1 + feedback/100)  # if feedback is positive, behavior increases, else decreases

    def apply_behavior(self, updated_behavior):
        for llm in self.llms:
            llm.update_behavior(updated_behavior)
```

Please note, that the `analyze_feedback` method is using a very simple rule for now. In a real-world scenario, this method would probably contain some complex learning algorithms.

Now let's move on to `InteractionModule`:

```python
# interaction.py

class InteractionModule:
    def __init__(self):
        pass  # initialize user interface here

    def handle_user_interaction(self, user):
        # This method captures user input and convert it into a Task
        input_data = self.get_user_input(user)
        task = self.format_to_task(input_data)
        return task

    def get_user_input(self, user):
        # this could be reading from a GUI, a console input, web API Input, etc.
        pass

    def format_to_task(self, input_data):
        # Converts user's input data into a Task
        pass

    def handle_llm_interaction(self, llm):
        # This method processes interactions from LLMs
        pass
```
In the `InteractionModule`, we need to modify `get_user_input` and `format_to_task` according to our GUI/console input/web API.

In the `CoordinationModule` we need to flesh out `compare_llm_data` and `update_llms_data` methods. These methods would be used to compare data or states across all LLMs and update them if there's any inconsistency.

And we haven't touched task distribution as well. We need to add code for that too! This would be an iterative process where we add small parts, review it, make changes and keep refining it. This iterative refinement is a significant part of the software development process. Eventually, we should have a working piece of software that we can test and further refine.
