Certainly! Let's continue with coding the `LearningModule`. This module will be responsible for adapting the behavior of the LLMs based on the feedback received from the user.

Here's a basic implementation for the `adapt_behavior` method:

```python
# learning.py
class LearningModule:
    def __init__(self, llms):
        self.llms = llms

    def adapt_behavior(self, feedback):
        """
        Change the behavior of the LLMs based on feedback.
        For this implementation, let assume behavior is just a simple numerical value.
        Better the feedback, higher the behavior.
        """
        new_behavior = self._calculate_new_behavior(feedback)
        for llm in self.llms:
            llm.update_behavior(new_behavior)

    def _calculate_new_behavior(self, feedback):
        """
        Calculate new behavior based on feedback
        This is a simplification, real implementation will have complex formula or even machine learning model!
        """
        return feedback / 10
```

Now let's update the `LLM` class to accept behavior modifications:

```python
# llm.py
class LLM:
    def __init__(self, initial_behavior = 5):
        self.behavior = initial_behavior

    def update_behavior(self, new_val):
        self.behavior = new_val
```

This implementation is very simple and you should expand it based on your needs. For example, we can implement some machine learning models in `_calculate_new_behavior` method to get more accurate behavior adjustments based on the feedback received.

Remember that testing your code at each modification is crucial to ensure that each part of your system works as expected. Please consider setting up unit tests for your modules and functions.
