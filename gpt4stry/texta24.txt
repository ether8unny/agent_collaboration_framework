Of course, let's bring all these components together to write a script that runs our system. Here is how we can do that. 

```python
# main.py
from llm import LLM
from learning import LearningModule
from coordination import CoordinationModule
from interaction import InteractionModule
from task import Task

# Initialize our coordination module 
coordination = CoordinationModule()

# Initialize our learning module with the llms from coordination
learning = LearningModule(coordination.llms)

# Initialize our interaction module with the learning module
interaction = InteractionModule(learning)

# Create a new task
new_task = Task('Write a research paper on collaborative AI', 95)

# Providing feedback on previous task completion and providing new task
interaction.receive_task(new_task, 30)
```

The `main.py` script initializes the `CoordinationModule`, `LearningModule`, and `InteractionModule` in that order, with the last module being initialized with the previous one. We then create a new task and provide it, along with feedback from a previous task, to the `receive_task` method of our `InteractionModule`.

This would be our primary script for running our collaborative framework. To verify its functionality, we would need to run it and observe the behaviour of our LLMs - how the task is distributed among them and how their behaviour adapts based on the feedback. 

Does this setup align with your thoughts?
