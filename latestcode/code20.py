```python
# Error handling: Consider adding appropriate error handling code to handle scenarios such as retrieving non-existent knowledge, updating or deleting non-existent knowledge, etc. This will help in catching and handling such exceptions gracefully.

# Input validation: Validate the inputs to the methods add_knowledge, get_knowledge, update_knowledge, and delete_knowledge. Ensure that the knowledge_id is a valid type (e.g., string or integer) and the knowledge is not None before performing any operations on the knowledge base.

# Consider using a database: Depending on the size and complexity of your application, you might consider using a database management system to store and manage the knowledge. This will provide better scalability, data integrity, and querying capabilities.

# Add additional retrieval methods: You might consider adding additional methods to retrieve knowledge based on specific criteria. For example, you could add a method to retrieve all knowledge that matches a particular category or a method to retrieve knowledge tagged with specific keywords.
