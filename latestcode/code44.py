```python
# 1. Input validation
# Validate the inputs to the `assign_task` and `unassign_task` methods.
# In addition to checking for None, you might consider adding additional checks,
# such as verifying that the task is of the expected type and format,
# and validating the assignee.

def assign_task(task, assignee):
    if task is None or assignee is None:
        raise ValueError("Invalid input: task or assignee cannot be None")
    # Additional input validation code here...


def unassign_task(task):
    if task is None:
        raise ValueError("Invalid input: task cannot be None")
    # Additional input validation code here...


# 2. Error handling
# Consider adding appropriate error handling code to handle scenarios
# like assigning a task that already has an assignee
# or unassigning a task that doesn't exist.
# You can raise custom exceptions or return specific error codes/messages
# to indicate the failure reason.

def assign_task(task, assignee):
    if task is None or assignee is None:
        raise ValueError("Invalid input: task or assignee cannot be None")
    if task.has_assignee():
        raise ValueError("Task already assigned to another assignee")
    # Additional error handling code here...


def unassign_task(task):
    if task is None:
        raise ValueError("Invalid input: task cannot be None")
    if not task.has_assignee():
        raise ValueError("Task does not have an assignee")
    # Additional error handling code here...


# 3. Task tracking
# Depending on the requirements of your project,
# you might consider adding functionality to track additional information about each task.
# This could include storing metadata such as the timestamp
# when a task was assigned or the completion status of each task.

class Task:
    def __init__(self, task_id, assignee):
        self.task_id = task_id
        self.assignee = assignee
        self.timestamp = None
        self.completed = False

    def assign(self, assignee):
        self.assignee = assignee
        self.timestamp = datetime.now()

    def mark_completed(self):
        self.completed = True


# 4. Task reassignment
# If your project requires the ability to reassign tasks from one assignee to another,
# you might consider adding a method for that.
# This will enable more flexible task management and coordination.

class Task:
    def __init__(self, task_id, assignee):
        self.task_id = task_id
        self.assignee = assignee
        self.timestamp = None
        self.completed = False

    def reassign(self, new_assignee):
        self.assignee = new_assignee

    def mark_completed(self):
        self.completed = True


# 5. Documentation
# Consider adding docstrings to the methods to provide clear and concise explanations
# of their purpose and usage.
# This will help other developers understand and use your code more easily.
