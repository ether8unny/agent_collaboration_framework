Code block 1:

```python
1. Input validation: Validate the inputs to the `store_learning_data` and `remove_learning_data` methods. In addition to checking for None, you might consider adding additional checks, such as verifying that the key is of the expected type and is unique.
```

Code block 2:

```python
2. Error handling: Consider adding appropriate error handling code to handle scenarios like storing learning data with an already existing key or removing a non-existent key. You can raise custom exceptions or return specific error codes/messages to indicate the failure reason.
```

Code block 3:

```python
3. Learning data persistence: Depending on the requirements of your project, you might consider adding functionality to persist the learning data to a database or file system. This will enable data retrieval even after the program is restarted.
```

Code block 4:

```python
4. Learning data validation: If your project requires stricter validation of the stored learning data, you might consider adding additional checks or constraints to the `store_learning_data` method, such as checking for valid data types or enforcing specific data structure rules.
```

Code block 5:

```python
5. Documentation: Consider adding docstrings to the methods to provide clear and concise explanations of their purpose and usage. This will help other developers understand and use your code more easily.
```
