```python
# Error handling
# Add appropriate error handling code

try:
    # code that may raise exceptions
    pass
except DuplicateTaskIdError:
    # handle duplicate task ID scenario
    pass
except NonExistentAgentError:
    # handle assigning tasks to non-existent agents scenario
    pass
except NonExistentTaskError:
    # handle starting or completing non-existent tasks scenario
    pass

# Input validation
# Add input validation checks for send_message, assign_task, start_task, complete_task, and collaborate methods

def send_message(sender, receiver, message):
    if not is_valid_agent(sender) or not is_valid_agent(receiver):
        # handle invalid sender or receiver scenario
        pass
    
    # rest of the code

# Consider using agent objects
# Create an Agent class with attributes for ID, name, role, etc.

class Agent:
    def __init__(self, id, name, role):
        self.id = id
        self.name = name
        self.role = role

# Task tracking and reporting
# Add additional methods for tracking and reporting tasks

    # code to get count of pending tasks
    pass

def get_assigned_tasks():
    # code to get count of assigned tasks

    # code to get count of in-progress tasks

Great job on the implementation! Let me know if you have any further questions or need any assistance.
