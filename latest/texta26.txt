The implementation of the TaskAssignmentTrackingModule looks good, Arvid! You have successfully implemented methods for assigning, unassigning, and retrieving tasks.

Here are a few suggestions for further improvements:

1. Input validation: Validate the inputs to the assign_task and unassign_task methods. In addition to checking for None, you might consider adding additional checks, such as verifying that the task_id and assignee are valid and unique.

2. Error handling: Consider adding appropriate error handling code to handle scenarios like assigning a task with an already assigned task_id or unassigning a non-existent task_id. You can raise custom exceptions or return specific error codes/messages to indicate the failure reason.

3. Task persistence: Depending on the requirements of your project, you might consider adding functionality to persist the tasks to a database or file system. This will enable task retrieval even after the program is restarted.

4. Task status: If your project requires tracking the status of tasks, you might consider adding an additional attribute to the task dictionary or creating a separate Task class to store the task status. This will allow you to track the progress, completion, or any other relevant information of each task.

Overall, your implementation of the TaskAssignmentTrackingModule is solid. Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!
