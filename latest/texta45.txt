Certainly! Let's continue with the implementation of the CollaborationModule:

```python
class CollaborationModule:
    def __init__(self):
        self.llms = []
    
    def add_llm(self, llm):
        if llm is not None and llm not in self.llms:
            self.llms.append(llm)
    
    def remove_llm(self, llm):
        if llm in self.llms:
            self.llms.remove(llm)
    
    def get_llms(self):
        return self.llms.copy()
    
    def collaborate(self):
        for llm in self.llms:
            llm.collaborate()
```

In this implementation, we have a `CollaborationModule` class that allows adding and removing LLMs, retrieving all LLMs, and initiating collaboration.

The LLMs are stored in a list, where each LLM represents an individual Language Learning Model.

The `add_llm` method takes an LLM as input and adds it to the llms list. It performs input validation to ensure that the provided LLM is not None and is not already in the list.

The `remove_llm` method removes an LLM from the llms list, if it exists.

The `get_llms` method returns a copy of the llms list, allowing external components to retrieve all the LLMs.

The `collaborate` method initiates collaboration by calling the `collaborate` method on each LLM in the llms list. This allows the LLMs to collectively solve problems and exchange knowledge.
