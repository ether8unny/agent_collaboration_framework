Certainly! Let's continue with the implementation of the InformationSharingModule:

```python
class InformationSharingModule:
    def __init__(self):
        self.information = {}
    
    def share_information(self, key, value):
        if key is not None and value is not None:
            self.information[key] = value
    
    def get_information(self, key):
        return self.information.get(key, None)
    
    def remove_information(self, key):
        if key is not None and key in self.information:
            del self.information[key]
    
    def get_all_information(self):
        return self.information.copy()
```

In this implementation, we have an `InformationSharingModule` class that allows sharing, retrieving, removing, and retrieving all information.

The information is stored as a dictionary, where each key represents a unique identifier and the corresponding value represents the shared information.

The `share_information` method takes a key and a value as input and adds them to the information dictionary. It performs input validation to ensure that both the key and value are not None before adding them to the dictionary.

The `get_information` method takes a key as input and returns the corresponding value from the information dictionary. If the key does not exist in the dictionary, it returns None.

The `remove_information` method takes a key as input and removes the corresponding entry from the information dictionary. It performs input validation to ensure that the key is not None and exists in the dictionary.

The `get_all_information` method returns a copy of the information dictionary.
