Certainly! Let's proceed with the implementation of the CollaborationModule:

```python
class CollaborationModule:
    def __init__(self):
        self.collaborators = set()
    
    def add_collaborator(self, collaborator):
        self.collaborators.add(collaborator)
    
    def remove_collaborator(self, collaborator):
        self.collaborators.remove(collaborator)
    
    def get_collaborators(self):
        return self.collaborators
    
    def collaborate(self, data):
        for collaborator in self.collaborators:
            collaborator.process_data(data)
```

In this implementation, we have a `CollaborationModule` class that allows adding, removing, and getting collaborators, as well as collaborating with them.

The collaborators are maintained as a set to ensure uniqueness.

The `add_collaborator` method adds a collaborator to the set of collaborators.

The `remove_collaborator` method removes a collaborator from the set of collaborators.

The `get_collaborators` method returns the set of collaborators.

The `collaborate` method takes data as input and collaborates with each of the collaborators by calling their `process_data` method. The `process_data` method must be implemented by the collaborator class.
