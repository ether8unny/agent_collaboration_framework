Great job, Arvid! The implementation of the `CollaborationModule` looks good. 

You have successfully implemented methods for adding collaborators, removing collaborators, retrieving all collaborators, and facilitating task collaboration.

Here are a few suggestions for further improvements:

1. Input validation: Validate the input to the `add_collaborator` and `remove_collaborator` methods. In addition to checking for None, you might consider adding additional checks, such as verifying that the collaborator is an instance of a specific class or has certain required attributes. This will help ensure that only valid collaborators are added or removed.

2. Error handling: Consider adding appropriate error handling code to handle scenarios like adding a duplicate collaborator or removing a non-existent collaborator. You can raise custom exceptions or return specific error codes/messages to indicate the failure reason.

3. Collaboration task tracking: Depending on the requirements of your project, you might consider adding functionality to track the progress or status of collaboration tasks. This could include storing additional information about each task, such as the timestamp when it was assigned, the collaborator who completed it, or any additional metadata.

4. Task prioritization: If your project requires prioritizing tasks or assigning different levels of importance to them, you might consider adding methods or attributes to represent and update the priority level of a task. This will enable more advanced task management and coordination.

5. Documentation: Consider adding docstrings to the methods to provide clear and concise explanations of their purpose and usage. This will help other developers understand and use your code more easily.

Overall, your implementation of the `CollaborationModule` is solid. Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!
