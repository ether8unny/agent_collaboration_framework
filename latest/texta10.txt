Great job, Arvid! The implementation of the CollaborationModule and InformationSharingModule classes looks good. You have successfully created the necessary methods to create tasks, assign tasks, start and complete tasks, and share/retrieve information.

Here are a few suggestions for further improvements:

1. Error handling: Consider adding appropriate error handling code to handle scenarios such as invalid task IDs, duplicate task assignments, etc. This will help in catching and handling such exceptions gracefully.

2. Task status validation: In the start_task and complete_task methods, consider adding additional checks to validate if a task is in the appropriate status before starting or completing it. For example, you might want to check if a task is already in progress before updating its status to "In Progress".

3. Input validation: Consider adding input validation checks for the create_task and share_information methods. Validate if the provided task ID or information ID is unique and not already present in the corresponding data structures.

4. Consider using a Task object: Instead of using a dictionary to represent tasks, you might consider creating a Task class with attributes for id, description, assignee, and status. This will provide a more structured and object-oriented approach to working with tasks.

Overall, you have done a great job in implementing the requested modules. Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!
