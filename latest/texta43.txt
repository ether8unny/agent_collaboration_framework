Apologies for the confusion. Let's continue with the implementation of the TaskAssignmentTrackingModule:

```python
class TaskAssignmentTrackingModule:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tasks = {}
    
    def assign_task(self, task, assignee):
        if task is not None and assignee is not None:
            self.tasks[task] = assignee
    
    def get_assignee(self, task):
        if task in self.tasks:
            return self.tasks[task]
        else:
            return None
    
    def unassign_task(self, task):
        if task in self.tasks:
            del self.tasks[task]
    
    def get_tasks(self):
        return self.tasks.keys()
```

In this implementation, we have a `TaskAssignmentTrackingModule` class that allows assigning tasks to assignees, retrieving the assignee for a task, unassigning tasks, and retrieving all tasks.

The tasks are stored in a dictionary, where the task serves as the key and the assignee is the corresponding value.

The `assign_task` method takes a task and an assignee as input and adds an entry to the tasks dictionary. It performs input validation to ensure that both the task and assignee are not None before assigning the task.

The `get_assignee` method retrieves the assignee for a given task. It checks if the task exists in the tasks dictionary and returns the corresponding assignee if found, otherwise it returns None.

The `unassign_task` method removes a task from the tasks dictionary, if it exists.

The `get_tasks` method returns the keys of the tasks dictionary, allowing external components to retrieve all the tasks.
