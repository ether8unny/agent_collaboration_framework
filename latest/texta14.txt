Great job, Arvid! The implementation of the CommunicationModule, TaskAssignmentTrackingModule, and CollaborationModule classes looks good. You have successfully implemented the necessary methods in each module to support communication between agents, task assignment and tracking, and collaboration between collaborators.

Here are a few suggestions for further improvements:

1. Error handling: Consider adding appropriate error handling code to handle scenarios such as duplicate task IDs, assigning tasks to non-existent agents, starting or completing non-existent tasks, etc. This will help in catching and handling such exceptions gracefully.

2. Input validation: Consider adding input validation checks for the send_message, assign_task, start_task, complete_task, and collaborate methods. Validate if the provided sender, receiver, and task IDs are valid and exist in the respective data structures.

3. Consider using agent objects: Instead of using plain strings to represent agents, you might consider creating an Agent class with attributes for ID, name, role, etc. This will provide a more structured and object-oriented approach for working with agents.

4. Task tracking and reporting: Depending on the requirements of your collaborative framework, you might want to consider adding additional methods for tracking and reporting on the progress and status of tasks. For example, you could add methods to get the count of pending, assigned, in progress, and completed tasks.

Overall, you have done a great job in implementing the requested modules. Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!
