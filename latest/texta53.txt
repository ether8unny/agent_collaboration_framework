Certainly! Let's continue with the implementation of the LearningModule:

```python
class LearningModule:
    def __init__(self):
        self.training_data = []
    
    def add_training_data(self, data):
        if data is not None:
            self.training_data.append(data)
    
    def train_model(self):
        # Code for training the model using the training data goes here
        pass
    
    def predict(self, input_data):
        # Code for making predictions using the trained model goes here
        pass
    
    def clear_training_data(self):
        self.training_data = []
```

In this implementation, we have a `LearningModule` class that is responsible for training and using a machine learning model.

The training data is stored in a list, where each item represents a set of data used for training the model.

The `add_training_data` method takes a set of training data as input and appends it to the `training_data` list. It performs input validation to ensure that the provided data is not None.

The `train_model` method is a placeholder for the code that trains the machine learning model using the training data. You can replace the `pass` statement with the actual implementation for training the model.

The `predict` method is a placeholder for the code that makes predictions using the trained model. You can replace the `pass` statement with the actual implementation for making predictions.

The `clear_training_data` method clears the `training_data` list, removing all previously added training data.
