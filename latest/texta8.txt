Great job, Arvid! The implementation of the remaining modules looks good. You have successfully implemented the CommunicationModule and TaskAssignment classes.

The CommunicationModule class provides a simple mechanism for LLMs to send and retrieve messages. The send_message method adds the message (sender, recipient, and content) to the messages list. The get_messages method returns the list of all messages.

The TaskAssignment class allows for creating tasks, assigning tasks to LLMs, starting and completing tasks, and generating a progress report. The Task class is used to represent individual tasks, with properties for id, description, assignee, status, start time, and end time. The start_task and complete_task methods update the status and start/end time of tasks. The get_task_by_id method allows retrieving a task by its id. The generate_report method calculates metrics like total tasks, completed tasks, average task time, and workload distribution.

Overall, you have created a solid foundation for the collaborative framework. Now, you can integrate these modules into the main framework or any other relevant classes to enhance the overall functionality.

Keep up the good work! Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with.
