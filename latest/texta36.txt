Great job, Arvid! The implementation of the `CommunicationsModule` looks good. You have successfully implemented methods for sending messages, receiving messages, and clearing messages.

Here are a few suggestions for further improvements:

1. Input validation: Validate the input to the `send_message` method. In addition to checking for None, you might consider adding additional checks, such as verifying that the message is of the expected type or format.

2. Error handling: Consider adding appropriate error handling code to handle scenarios like sending an invalid message or receiving messages when there are none. You can raise custom exceptions or return specific error codes/messages to indicate the failure reason.

3. Message formatting: Depending on the requirements of your project, you might consider adding functionality to format or encode the messages in a specific format. This could include adding metadata to the messages or formatting the messages as JSON, XML, or another structured format.

4. Message filtering: If your project requires filtering or sorting of messages, you might consider adding methods to filter or sort the messages based on specific criteria. This will enable more advanced message processing and analysis.

5. Documentation: Consider adding docstrings to the methods to provide clear and concise explanations of their purpose and usage. This will help other developers understand and use your code more easily.

Overall, your implementation of the `CommunicationsModule` is solid. Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!
