Certainly! Let's continue with the implementation of the CollaborationModule:

```python
class CollaborationModule:
    def __init__(self):
        self.collaborators = set()
    
    def add_collaborator(self, collaborator):
        if collaborator is not None:
            self.collaborators.add(collaborator)
    
    def remove_collaborator(self, collaborator):
        if collaborator is not None:
            self.collaborators.remove(collaborator)
    
    def collaborate(self, task):
        for collaborator in self.collaborators:
            collaborator.perform_task(task)
```

In this implementation, we have a `CollaborationModule` class that allows adding collaborators, removing collaborators, and initiating collaboration.

The collaborators are stored as a set in the `collaborators` attribute of the class.

The `add_collaborator` method takes a collaborator as input and adds them to the set of collaborators. It performs input validation to ensure that the collaborator is not None before adding them to the set.

The `remove_collaborator` method takes a collaborator as input and removes them from the set of collaborators. It performs input validation to ensure that the collaborator is not None before removing them from the set.

The `collaborate` method takes a task as input and iterates over the set of collaborators, invoking the `perform_task` method for each collaborator. This allows the collaborators to collectively work on the task.
