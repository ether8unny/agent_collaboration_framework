Great job, Arvid! The implementation of the `TaskAssignmentAndTrackingModule` looks good. 

You have successfully implemented methods for assigning tasks, retrieving the assigned agent for a given task, removing tasks, and retrieving all tasks.

Here are a few suggestions for further improvements:

1. Input validation: Validate the inputs to the `assign_task` and `remove_task` methods. In addition to checking for None, you might consider adding additional checks, such as verifying that the task_id and assigned_to are of the expected type and format.

2. Error handling: Consider adding appropriate error handling code to handle scenarios like assigning a task with an already existing task_id or removing a non-existent task_id. You can raise custom exceptions or return specific error codes/messages to indicate the failure reason.

3. Task tracking history: Depending on the requirements of your project, you might consider adding functionality to track the history of task assignments. This could include storing additional information about each assignment, such as the timestamp, the user who assigned the task, or any additional metadata.

4. Task status and progress: If your project requires tracking the status or progress of tasks, you might consider adding methods or attributes to represent and update the status or progress of a task. This will enable more advanced task management and monitoring.

5. Documentation: Consider adding docstrings to the methods to provide clear and concise explanations of their purpose and usage. This will help other developers understand and use your code more easily.

Overall, your implementation of the `TaskAssignmentAndTrackingModule` is solid. Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!
