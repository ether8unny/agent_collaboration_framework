Great work, Arvid! The implementation of the `CommunicationModule` looks good.

You have successfully implemented methods for sending messages, retrieving all messages, and filtering messages by sender and recipient.

Here are a few suggestions for further improvements:

1. Input validation: Validate the inputs to the `send_message` method. In addition to checking for None, you might consider adding additional checks, such as verifying that the sender and recipient are of the expected type.

2. Error handling: Consider adding appropriate error handling code to handle scenarios like sending a message without a sender, recipient, or content. You can raise custom exceptions or return specific error codes/messages to indicate the failure reason.

3. Message format: Depending on the requirements of your project, you might consider defining a message object or class to store the sender, recipient, and content. This can provide better structure to the messages and make them easier to work with.

4. Message history: If your project requires keeping a history of messages, you might consider adding functionality to track additional information about each message. This could include storing metadata such as the timestamp when a message was sent or received, the status of the message (read/unread), or the importance/priority of each message.

5. Message persistence: If your project requires persisting messages across multiple sessions or system restarts, you might consider implementing mechanisms for storing and retrieving messages from a database or file system.

6. Documentation: Consider adding docstrings to the methods to provide clear and concise explanations of their purpose and usage. This will help other developers understand and use your code more easily.

Overall, your implementation of the `CommunicationModule` is solid. Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!
