Great work, Arvid! The implementation of the `TaskAssignmentTrackingModule` looks good.

You have successfully implemented methods for assigning tasks, retrieving the assignee for a task, removing task assignments, and clearing all task assignments.

Here are a few suggestions for further improvements:

1. Input validation: Validate the inputs to the `assign_task` method. In addition to checking for None, you might consider adding additional checks, such as verifying that the task ID is of the expected type and that the assignee is valid.

2. Error handling: Consider adding appropriate error handling code to handle scenarios like assigning a task with an existing task ID or retrieving an assignee for a non-existent task ID. You can raise custom exceptions or return specific error codes/messages to indicate the failure reason.

3. Persistence: If your project requires persisting the task assignments across multiple sessions or system restarts, you might consider implementing mechanisms for storing and retrieving the task assignments from a database or file system.

4. Documentation: Consider adding docstrings to the methods to provide clear and concise explanations of their purpose and usage. This will help other developers understand and use your code more easily.

Overall, your implementation of the `TaskAssignmentTrackingModule` is solid. Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!
