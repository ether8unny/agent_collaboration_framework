Sure! Let's continue with the implementation of the `LearningModule`:

```python
class LearningModule:
    def __init__(self):
        self.training_data = []
    
    def add_training_data(self, data):
        if data is not None:
            self.training_data.append(data)
    
    def get_training_data(self):
        return self.training_data
    
    def clear_training_data(self):
        self.training_data = []
```

In this implementation, we have a `LearningModule` class that provides functionality for adding and retrieving training data.

The training data is stored in a list called `training_data`.

The `add_training_data` method takes training data as input and appends it to the `training_data` list. It performs input validation to ensure that the data is not None.

The `get_training_data` method returns the entire `training_data` list.

The `clear_training_data` method clears the entire `training_data` list, removing all previously stored training data.

By providing functionality for adding and retrieving training data, the `LearningModule` enables adaptive learning and the improvement of the LLMs' capabilities over time.
