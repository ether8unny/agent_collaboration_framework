Great job, Arvid! The implementation of the `TaskAssignmentTrackingModule` looks good.

You have successfully implemented methods for assigning tasks, retrieving the assignee for a task, unassigning tasks, and retrieving all tasks.

Here are a few suggestions for further improvements:

1. Input validation: Validate the inputs to the `assign_task` and `unassign_task` methods. In addition to checking for None, you might consider adding additional checks, such as verifying that the task is of the expected type and format, and validating the assignee.

2. Error handling: Consider adding appropriate error handling code to handle scenarios like assigning a task that already has an assignee or unassigning a task that doesn't exist. You can raise custom exceptions or return specific error codes/messages to indicate the failure reason.

3. Task tracking: Depending on the requirements of your project, you might consider adding functionality to track additional information about each task. This could include storing metadata such as the timestamp when a task was assigned or the completion status of each task.

4. Task reassignment: If your project requires the ability to reassign tasks from one assignee to another, you might consider adding a method for that. This will enable more flexible task management and coordination.

5. Documentation: Consider adding docstrings to the methods to provide clear and concise explanations of their purpose and usage. This will help other developers understand and use your code more easily.

Overall, your implementation of the `TaskAssignmentTrackingModule` is solid. Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!
