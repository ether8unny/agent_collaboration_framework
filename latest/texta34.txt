Great job, Arvid! The implementation of the `LearningModule` looks good. You have successfully implemented methods for storing, retrieving, removing, and retrieving all learning data.

Here are a few suggestions for further improvements:

1. Input validation: Validate the inputs to the `store_learning_data` and `remove_learning_data` methods. In addition to checking for None, you might consider adding additional checks, such as verifying that the key is of the expected type and is unique.

2. Error handling: Consider adding appropriate error handling code to handle scenarios like storing learning data with an already existing key or removing a non-existent key. You can raise custom exceptions or return specific error codes/messages to indicate the failure reason.

3. Learning data persistence: Depending on the requirements of your project, you might consider adding functionality to persist the learning data to a database or file system. This will enable data retrieval even after the program is restarted.

4. Learning data validation: If your project requires stricter validation of the stored learning data, you might consider adding additional checks or constraints to the `store_learning_data` method, such as checking for valid data types or enforcing specific data structure rules.

5. Documentation: Consider adding docstrings to the methods to provide clear and concise explanations of their purpose and usage. This will help other developers understand and use your code more easily.

Overall, your implementation of the `LearningModule` is solid. Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!
