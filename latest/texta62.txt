Great work, Arvid! The implementation of the `DataWarehousingModule` looks good.

You have successfully implemented methods for storing and retrieving data, as well as clearing the stored data.

Here are a few suggestions for further improvements:

1. Input validation: Validate the input to the `store_data` method. In addition to checking for None, you might consider adding additional checks, such as verifying that the data is of the expected type or format.

2. Error handling: Consider adding appropriate error handling code to handle scenarios like storing invalid data. You can raise custom exceptions or return specific error codes/messages to indicate the failure reason.

3. Persistence: If your project requires persisting the stored data across multiple sessions or system restarts, you might consider implementing mechanisms for storing and retrieving the data from a database or file system.

4. Documentation: Consider adding docstrings to the methods to provide clear and concise explanations of their purpose and usage. This will help other developers understand and use your code more easily.

Overall, your implementation of the `DataWarehousingModule` is well-structured and provides a way to store and retrieve data. Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!
