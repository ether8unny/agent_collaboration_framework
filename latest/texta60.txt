Great work, Arvid! The implementation of the `InformationSharingModule` looks good.

You have successfully implemented methods for sharing and retrieving information, as well as removing and clearing shared information.

Here are a few suggestions for further improvements:

1. Input validation: Validate the inputs to the `share_information` method. In addition to checking for None, you might consider adding additional checks, such as verifying that the key is of the expected type and that the value is valid.

2. Error handling: Consider adding appropriate error handling code to handle scenarios like sharing information with an existing key or retrieving information for a non-existent key. You can raise custom exceptions or return specific error codes/messages to indicate the failure reason.

3. Persistence: If your project requires persisting the shared information across multiple sessions or system restarts, you might consider implementing mechanisms for storing and retrieving the information from a database or file system.

4. Documentation: Consider adding docstrings to the methods to provide clear and concise explanations of their purpose and usage. This will help other developers understand and use your code more easily.

Overall, your implementation of the `InformationSharingModule` is well-structured and provides an effective way to share and retrieve information. Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!
