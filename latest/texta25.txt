Certainly! Let's continue with the implementation of the TaskAssignmentTrackingModule:

```python
class TaskAssignmentTrackingModule:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tasks = {}
    
    def assign_task(self, task_id, assignee):
        if task_id is None or assignee is None:
            return False
        
        self.tasks[task_id] = assignee
        return True
    
    def unassign_task(self, task_id):
        if task_id is None or task_id not in self.tasks:
            return False
        
        del self.tasks[task_id]
        return True
    
    def get_assignee(self, task_id):
        return self.tasks.get(task_id, None)
    
    def get_all_tasks(self):
        return list(self.tasks.keys())
```

In this implementation, we have a `TaskAssignmentTrackingModule` class that allows assigning, unassigning, and retrieving tasks.

The tasks are stored as a dictionary, where the keys represent the task ID and the values represent the assignees.

The `assign_task` method takes a task ID and an assignee as input and assigns the task to the assignee by adding an entry to the tasks dictionary. It performs basic input validation to ensure that none of the parameters are None. If any of the parameters are None, it returns False to indicate that the task was not assigned. Otherwise, it returns True to indicate a successful assignment.

The `unassign_task` method takes a task ID as input and unassigns the task by removing its entry from the tasks dictionary. It performs basic input validation to ensure that the task ID is not None and exists in the tasks dictionary. If the task ID is None or does not exist in the dictionary, it returns False to indicate that the task was not unassigned. Otherwise, it returns True to indicate a successful unassignment.

The `get_assignee` method takes a task ID as input and returns the assignee of the task, or None if the task ID does not exist.

The `get_all_tasks` method returns a list of all task IDs.
