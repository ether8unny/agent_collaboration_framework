The implementation of the CollaborationModule looks good, Arvid! You have successfully implemented methods for adding collaborators, removing collaborators, and initiating collaboration.

Here are a few suggestions for further improvements:

1. Input validation: Validate the input to the add_collaborator and remove_collaborator methods. In addition to checking for None, you might consider adding additional checks, such as verifying that the collaborator is of the expected type and is not already a collaborator.

2. Error handling: Consider adding appropriate error handling code to handle scenarios like adding the same collaborator multiple times or removing a non-existent collaborator. You can raise custom exceptions or return specific error codes/messages to indicate the failure reason.

3. Collaborator interface: Ensure that the collaborators implement a common interface or inherit from a base class/interface. This will allow you to call the perform_task method without runtime errors or type checking.

4. Collaboration process: If your project requires a more complex collaboration process, you might consider adding additional methods to the CollaborationModule, such as start_collaboration or end_collaboration. These methods can handle the initialization and finalization steps of the collaboration process.

Overall, your implementation of the CollaborationModule is solid. Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!
