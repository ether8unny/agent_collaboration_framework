Certainly! Let's continue with the implementation of the CommunicationsModule:

```python
class CommunicationsModule:
    def __init__(self):
        self.messages = []
    
    def send_message(self, message):
        if message is not None:
            self.messages.append(message)
    
    def receive_messages(self):
        return self.messages.copy()
    
    def clear_messages(self):
        self.messages.clear()
```

In this implementation, we have a `CommunicationsModule` class that allows sending and receiving messages.

The messages are stored in a list, where each message represents a communication. The `send_message` method takes a message as input and appends it to the `messages` list. It performs input validation to ensure that the message is not None before adding it to the list.

The `receive_messages` method returns a copy of the `messages` list, allowing the receiver to retrieve all the messages that have been sent.

The `clear_messages` method clears the `messages` list, enabling the module to start fresh and clear any previously sent messages.
