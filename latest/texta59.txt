Certainly! Let's continue with the implementation of the InformationSharingModule:

```python
class InformationSharingModule:
    def __init__(self):
        self.shared_information = {}
    
    def share_information(self, key, value):
        if key is not None and value is not None:
            self.shared_information[key] = value
    
    def get_information(self, key):
        return self.shared_information.get(key, None)
    
    def remove_information(self, key):
        if key in self.shared_information:
            del self.shared_information[key]
    
    def clear_information(self):
        self.shared_information = {}
```

In this implementation, we have an `InformationSharingModule` class that provides functionality for sharing and retrieving information.

The shared information is stored in a dictionary, where each key represents a unique identifier for the information, and the value represents the actual information.

The `share_information` method takes a key and a value as input and stores the information in the `shared_information` dictionary. It performs input validation to ensure that both the key and the value are not None.

The `get_information` method takes a key as input and returns the corresponding information from the `shared_information` dictionary. If the key is not found in the dictionary, it returns None.

The `remove_information` method takes a key as input and removes the corresponding information from the `shared_information` dictionary, if it exists.

The `clear_information` method clears the entire `shared_information` dictionary, removing all previously shared information.

By providing functionality for sharing and retrieving information, the `InformationSharingModule` enables effective communication and collaboration between the LLMs and the users. It allows for the exchange of knowledge and facilitates collective problem-solving.
