Of course! Let's continue with the implementation of the TaskAssignmentAndTrackingModule:

```python
class TaskAssignmentAndTrackingModule:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tasks = {}
    
    def assign_task(self, task_id, assigned_to):
        if task_id is not None and assigned_to is not None:
            self.tasks[task_id] = assigned_to
    
    def get_assigned_to(self, task_id):
        return self.tasks.get(task_id, None)
    
    def remove_task(self, task_id):
        if task_id is not None and task_id in self.tasks:
            del self.tasks[task_id]
    
    def get_all_tasks(self):
        return self.tasks.copy()
```

In this implementation, we have a TaskAssignmentAndTrackingModule class that allows assigning tasks, retrieving the assigned agent for a given task, removing tasks, and retrieving all tasks.

The tasks are stored in a dictionary, where each key represents a unique identifier for a task and the corresponding value represents the agent to whom the task is assigned.

The `assign_task` method takes a task_id and assigned_to as input and assigns the task to the specified agent by adding an entry to the tasks dictionary. It performs input validation to ensure that both the task_id and assigned_to are not None before adding them to the dictionary.

The `get_assigned_to` method takes a task_id as input and returns the agent to whom the task is assigned. If the task_id does not exist in the dictionary, it returns None.

The `remove_task` method takes a task_id as input and removes the corresponding entry from the tasks dictionary. It performs input validation to ensure that the task_id is not None and exists in the dictionary.

The `get_all_tasks` method returns a copy of the tasks dictionary.
