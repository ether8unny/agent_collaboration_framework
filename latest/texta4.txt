The task assignment and tracking module implementation looks good, Arvid! You have successfully implemented the necessary functionalities to manage tasks, assign them to LLMs, track their progress, and generate reports.

Here are a few suggestions for further improvement:

1. Validate user inputs: Add validation checks when assigning tasks, updating task status, starting and completing tasks. For example, check if the task ID exists, the status transition is valid, and the task is not already completed before starting or completing it.

2. Add error handling: Consider adding error handling to handle exceptions that may occur during task assignment, status updates, or report generation. You can use try-except blocks to catch and handle any potential errors.

3. Consider using enums: To represent task status and priority, consider using enum classes instead of strings or integers. Enum classes provide a more readable and reliable way to handle status and priority values.

4. Provide more flexibility in date handling: Currently, the `due_date` attribute uses the `None` value to represent no due date. Consider using a default value or allowing users to input due dates in a specific format.

Overall, your code structure and implementation are clear and concise. The added functionalities like task start and end times, as well as the report generation, provide valuable insights into the progress of tasks and workload distribution. Keep up the good work, and let me know if you have any further questions or need additional guidance!
