Certainly! Let's continue with the implementation of the remaining modules.

Next, let's work on the data warehousing module:

```python
class DataWarehousingModule:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data_warehouse = {}
    
    def store_data(self, data_id, data):
        self.data_warehouse[data_id] = data
    
    def retrieve_data(self, data_id):
        return self.data_warehouse.get(data_id, None)
```

In this implementation, the `DataWarehousingModule` class allows for storing and retrieving data in a data warehouse. The data warehouse is represented as a dictionary, where the data ID is used as the key and the data itself is the value.

The `store_data` method stores data in the data warehouse by associating it with a unique data ID. The `retrieve_data` method retrieves data from the data warehouse based on the provided data ID. If the data ID is not found in the data warehouse, it returns `None`.

Finally, let's work on the learning module:

```python
class LearningModule:
    def __init__(self):
        self.knowledge_base = {}
    
    def add_knowledge(self, knowledge_id, knowledge):
        self.knowledge_base[knowledge_id] = knowledge
    
    def remove_knowledge(self, knowledge_id):
        if knowledge_id in self.knowledge_base:
            del self.knowledge_base[knowledge_id]
    
    def get_knowledge(self, knowledge_id):
        return self.knowledge_base.get(knowledge_id, None)
    
    def update_knowledge(self, knowledge_id, new_knowledge):
        if knowledge_id in self.knowledge_base:
            self.knowledge_base[knowledge_id] = new_knowledge
```

In this implementation, the `LearningModule` class allows for adding, removing, retrieving, and updating knowledge in a knowledge base. The knowledge base is represented as a dictionary, where the knowledge ID is used as the key and the knowledge itself is the value.

The `add_knowledge` method adds knowledge to the knowledge base by associating it with a unique knowledge ID. The `remove_knowledge` method removes knowledge from the knowledge base based on the provided knowledge ID. The `get_knowledge` method retrieves knowledge from the knowledge base based on the provided knowledge ID. If the knowledge ID is not found in the knowledge base, it returns `None`. The `update_knowledge` method updates existing knowledge in the knowledge base with new knowledge, based on the provided knowledge ID.

That completes the implementation of all the requested modules for the collaborative framework. Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!
