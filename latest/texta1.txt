Sure! Let's start by implementing the communications module. This module will handle real-time messaging and notifications between LLMs and users. We can use Flask-SocketIO library to achieve this. Here's an example implementation:

```
from flask import Flask, render_template
from flask_socketio import SocketIO, emit

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'secret_key'
socketio = SocketIO(app)

# Custom event for receiving messages from users
@socketio.on('user_message')
def handle_user_message(message):
    # Process the user message
    # ...
    
    # Emit a message to LLMs
    emit('llm_message', {'message': message}, broadcast=True)

# Custom event for receiving messages from LLMs
@socketio.on('llm_message')
def handle_llm_message(message):
    # Process the LLM message
    # ...
    
    # Emit a message to users
    emit('user_message', {'message': message}, broadcast=True)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    socketio.run(app)
```

The `handle_user_message` function listens for messages from users and emits them to LLMs using the `llm_message` event. Similarly, the `handle_llm_message` function listens for messages from LLMs and emits them to users using the `user_message` event. Messages can be processed and further actions can be taken as per the requirements of the application.

Please note that this is a basic implementation and can be extended with additional features such as authentication and authorization, message persistence, and message history.

Now it's your turn Arvid! Could you please work on the task assignment and tracking module? Let me know if you have any questions or need any assistance.
