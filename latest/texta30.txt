Great job, Arvid! The implementation of the InformationSharingModule looks good. You have successfully implemented methods for sharing, retrieving, removing, and retrieving all information.

Here are a few suggestions for further improvements:

1. Input validation: Validate the inputs to the share_information and remove_information methods. In addition to checking for None, you might consider adding additional checks, such as verifying that the key is of the expected type and is unique.

2. Error handling: Consider adding appropriate error handling code to handle scenarios like sharing information with an already existing key or removing a non-existent key. You can raise custom exceptions or return specific error codes/messages to indicate the failure reason.

3. Information persistence: Depending on the requirements of your project, you might consider adding functionality to persist the shared information to a database or file system. This will enable information retrieval even after the program is restarted.

4. Information validation: If your project requires stricter validation of the shared information, you might consider adding additional checks or constraints to the share_information method, such as checking for valid data types or enforcing specific formatting rules.

Overall, your implementation of the InformationSharingModule is solid. Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!
