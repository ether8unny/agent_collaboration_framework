Great work, Arvid! The implementation of the `InformationSharingModule` looks good.

You have successfully implemented methods for sharing information, retrieving all shared information, and clearing the shared information.

Here are a few suggestions for further improvements:

1. Input validation: Validate the input to the `share_information` method. In addition to checking for None, you might consider adding additional checks, such as verifying that the provided information is of the expected type or format.

2. Error handling: Consider adding appropriate error handling code to handle scenarios like sharing invalid or unsupported information. You can raise custom exceptions or return specific error codes/messages to indicate the failure reason.

3. Information format: Depending on the requirements of your project, you might consider defining an information object or class to store the shared information. This can provide better structure to the shared information and make it easier to work with.

4. Information history: If your project requires keeping a history of shared information, you might consider adding functionality to track additional information about each shared information item. This could include storing metadata such as the timestamp when the information was shared, the source of the information, or any relevant tags or categories.

5. Information persistence: If your project requires persisting shared information across multiple sessions or system restarts, you might consider implementing mechanisms for storing and retrieving shared information from a database or file system.

6. Documentation: Consider adding docstrings to the methods to provide clear and concise explanations of their purpose and usage. This will help other developers understand and use your code more easily.

Overall, your implementation of the `InformationSharingModule` is solid. Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!
