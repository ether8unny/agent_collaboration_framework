Great job, Arvid! The implementation of the `CommunicationModule` looks good.

You have successfully implemented methods for sending messages, retrieving all messages, and clearing the message history.

Here are a few suggestions for further improvements:

1. Input validation: Validate the inputs to the `send_message` method. In addition to checking for None, you might consider adding additional checks, such as verifying that the sender and recipient are of the expected type and format, and validating the message content.

2. Message format: Depending on the requirements of your project, you might consider refining the format of the messages. For example, you could use a dictionary instead of a tuple to store additional metadata such as timestamps or message IDs, or you could define a separate message class to encapsulate the message data and provide additional functionality.

3. Message filtering: If your project requires filtering or searching through messages based on certain criteria, you might consider adding methods to facilitate these operations. For example, you could add a method to retrieve all messages sent by a specific sender or received by a specific recipient.

4. Message archiving: If your project requires archiving or persisting the message history, you might consider adding functionality to save the messages to a database or file system. This will enable you to retrieve messages even after the program terminates or restarts.

5. Documentation: Consider adding docstrings to the methods to provide clear and concise explanations of their purpose and usage. This will help other developers understand and use your code more easily.

Overall, your implementation of the `CommunicationModule` is solid. Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!
