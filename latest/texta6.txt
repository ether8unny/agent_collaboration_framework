Great job, Arvid! The implementation of the remaining modules looks good. You have successfully implemented the CommunicationModule, CollaborationModule, InformationSharingModule, DataWarehousingModule, and LearningModule as separate classes with their respective functionalities.

These modules contribute to a collaborative environment where LLMs can communicate with each other, share information, collaborate on tasks, store and retrieve data, and receive user feedback. The classes are well-structured and adhere to the principles of encapsulation and code reusability.

Overall, you have created a solid foundation for the collaborative framework. Now, you can integrate these modules into the TaskAssignment class or any other relevant classes to enhance the overall functionality.

Keep up the good work! Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with.
