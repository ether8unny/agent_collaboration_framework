Great start on the communications module implementation, Arvid! It provides a simple and straightforward way to handle real-time messaging and notifications between LLMs and users using Flask-SocketIO. 

Now let's move on to the task assignment and tracking module. Here's a suggested approach:

1. Define a data structure to represent tasks. Each task can have attributes like a unique identifier, description, assignee(s), status, priority, and due date. You can use classes or dictionaries to represent tasks.

2. Implement a mechanism for task assignment. This can be done manually by allowing users to assign tasks to specific LLMs. You can provide a user interface where users can select a task from a list and assign it to an LLM. Alternatively, you can also implement an automatic task assignment algorithm based on availability, workload, and expertise of the LLMs.

3. Add functionality to track the progress of tasks. This can involve updating the status of a task as it moves through various stages (e.g., not started, in progress, completed). You can also include fields to track the start and end times of each task, as well as any dependencies between tasks.

4. Implement a reporting mechanism to generate reports on the overall progress of tasks. This can include metrics like the number of tasks completed, the average time taken to complete a task, and the workload distribution across LLMs. You can provide pre-defined reports or allow users to specify custom report criteria.

Here's a code snippet to get you started:

```python
class Task:
    def __init__(self, id, description, assignee=None, status='Not Started', priority=1, due_date=None):
        self.id = id
        self.description = description
        self.assignee = assignee
        self.status = status
        self.priority = priority
        self.due_date = due_date

class TaskAssignment:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tasks = {}
    
    def add_task(self, task):
        self.tasks[task.id] = task
    
    def assign_task(self, task_id, assignee):
        if task_id in self.tasks:
            self.tasks[task_id].assignee = assignee
    
    def update_task_status(self, task_id, status):
        if task_id in self.tasks:
            self.tasks[task_id].status = status
    
    def get_all_tasks(self):
        return list(self.tasks.values())

if __name__ == '__main__':
    assignment = TaskAssignment()
    task1 = Task(1, 'Implement feature A')
    task2 = Task(2, 'Test feature A')
    assignment.add_task(task1)
    assignment.add_task(task2)
    
    assignment.assign_task(1, 'LLM1')
    assignment.update_task_status(1, 'In Progress')
    
    tasks = assignment.get_all_tasks()
    for task in tasks:
        print(f'Task {task.id}: {task.description}, Assignee: {task.assignee}, Status: {task.status}')
```

In this code snippet, we define a `Task` class to represent individual tasks and a `TaskAssignment` class to manage the task assignment and tracking functionality. We can add tasks using the `add_task` method, assign tasks to LLMs using the `assign_task` method, update task status using the `update_task_status` method, and retrieve all tasks using the `get_all_tasks` method.
