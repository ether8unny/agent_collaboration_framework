The implementation of the CommunicationsModule looks good, Arvid! You have successfully implemented methods for sending and retrieving messages.

Here are a few suggestions for further improvements:

1. Input validation: Validate the inputs to the send_message method. In addition to checking for None, you might consider adding additional checks, such as verifying that the sender and recipient are valid and unique, and that the message is not empty or too long.

2. Message format: Consider defining a Message class to encapsulate the sender, recipient, and message attributes. This will provide better type checking and ensure consistent message objects throughout your codebase.

3. Message persistence: Depending on the requirements of your project, you might consider adding functionality to persist the messages to a database or file system. This will enable message retrieval even after the program is restarted.

4. Real-time messaging: If your project requires real-time messaging between collaborators, you might consider using a messaging library or framework, such as RabbitMQ, ZeroMQ, or websockets. These libraries can help you handle message routing, delivery guarantees, and other messaging-related features.

Overall, your implementation of the CommunicationsModule is solid. Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!
