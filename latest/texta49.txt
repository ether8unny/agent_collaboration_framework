Certainly! Let's continue with the implementation of the InformationSharingModule:

```python
class InformationSharingModule:
    def __init__(self):
        self.shared_information = []
    
    def share_information(self, information):
        if information is not None:
            self.shared_information.append(information)
    
    def get_shared_information(self):
        return self.shared_information.copy()
    
    def clear_shared_information(self):
        self.shared_information = []
```

In this implementation, we have a `InformationSharingModule` class that allows sharing and retrieving information.

The shared information is stored in a list, where each item represents a piece of shared information.

The `share_information` method takes a piece of information as input and appends it to the `shared_information` list. It performs input validation to ensure that the provided information is not None.

The `get_shared_information` method returns a copy of the `shared_information` list, allowing external components to retrieve all the shared information.

The `clear_shared_information` method clears the `shared_information` list, removing all previously shared information.
