Certainly! Let's continue with the implementation of the TaskAssignmentTrackingModule:

```python
class TaskAssignmentTrackingModule:
    def __init__(self):
        self.task_assignments = {}
    
    def assign_task(self, task_id, assignee):
        if task_id is not None and assignee is not None:
            self.task_assignments[task_id] = assignee
    
    def get_assignee(self, task_id):
        return self.task_assignments.get(task_id, None)
    
    def remove_assignment(self, task_id):
        if task_id in self.task_assignments:
            del self.task_assignments[task_id]
    
    def clear_assignments(self):
        self.task_assignments = {}
```

In this implementation, we have a `TaskAssignmentTrackingModule` class that provides functionality for assigning tasks to agents and tracking the assignments.

The task assignments are stored in a dictionary, where each key represents a unique identifier for the task, and the value represents the agent assigned to the task.

The `assign_task` method takes a task ID and an assignee as input and stores the assignment in the `task_assignments` dictionary. It performs input validation to ensure that both the task ID and the assignee are not None.

The `get_assignee` method takes a task ID as input and returns the corresponding assignee from the `task_assignments` dictionary. If the task ID is not found in the dictionary, it returns None.

The `remove_assignment` method takes a task ID as input and removes the corresponding task assignment from the `task_assignments` dictionary, if it exists.

The `clear_assignments` method clears the entire `task_assignments` dictionary, removing all previously assigned tasks.
