Certainly! Let's continue with the implementation of the DataWarehousingModule:

```python
class DataWarehousingModule:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data_warehouse = {}
    
    def store_data(self, key, data):
        if key is not None and data is not None:
            self.data_warehouse[key] = data
    
    def get_data(self, key):
        return self.data_warehouse.get(key, None)
    
    def remove_data(self, key):
        if key in self.data_warehouse:
            del self.data_warehouse[key]
    
    def clear_data_warehouse(self):
        self.data_warehouse = {}
```

In this implementation, we have a `DataWarehousingModule` class that provides functionality for storing, retrieving, and removing data from a data warehouse.

The data warehouse is implemented as a dictionary, where each key represents a unique identifier for the data, and the value represents the actual data.

The `store_data` method takes a key-value pair as input and stores it in the data warehouse. It performs input validation to ensure that both the key and the data are not None.

The `get_data` method takes a key as input and returns the corresponding data from the data warehouse. If the key is not found in the data warehouse, it returns None.

The `remove_data` method takes a key as input and removes the corresponding data from the data warehouse, if it exists.

The `clear_data_warehouse` method clears the entire data warehouse, removing all previously stored data.
