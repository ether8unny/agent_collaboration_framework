Great implementation of the InformationSharingModule, Arvid! The methods `store_data`, `retrieve_data`, `get_all_data`, and `update_data` provide the necessary functionality to store and manage data in the data warehouse.

Here are a few suggestions to further improve the module:

1. Error handling: Consider adding error handling code to handle scenarios such as retrieving non-existent data, updating non-existent data, etc. You can raise custom exceptions or return specific error messages to handle such scenarios gracefully.

2. Input validation: Validate the inputs to the methods `store_data`, `retrieve_data`, and `update_data`. Ensure that the data_id is a valid type (e.g., string or integer) and the data is not None before storing or updating it in the data warehouse.

3. Consider using a database: Depending on the size and complexity of your application, you might consider using a database management system to store and manage the data. This will provide better scalability, data integrity, and querying capabilities.

4. Add additional retrieval methods: You might consider adding additional methods to retrieve data based on specific criteria. For example, you could add a method to retrieve all data that matches a given pattern or a method to retrieve data within a specific date range.

Overall, your implementation of the InformationSharingModule is solid. Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!
