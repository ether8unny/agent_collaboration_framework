Certainly! Let's continue with the implementation of the LearningModule:

```python
class LearningModule:
    def __init__(self):
        self.knowledge_base = {}

    def add_knowledge(self, knowledge_id, knowledge):
        if knowledge_id not in self.knowledge_base:
            self.knowledge_base[knowledge_id] = knowledge
            return True
        return False

    def get_knowledge(self, knowledge_id):
        return self.knowledge_base.get(knowledge_id)

    def update_knowledge(self, knowledge_id, knowledge):
        if knowledge_id in self.knowledge_base:
            self.knowledge_base[knowledge_id] = knowledge
            return True
        return False

    def delete_knowledge(self, knowledge_id):
        if knowledge_id in self.knowledge_base:
            del self.knowledge_base[knowledge_id]
            return True
        return False

    def get_all_knowledge(self):
        return list(self.knowledge_base.items())
```

In this implementation, we have a `LearningModule` class that allows for adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting knowledge in the knowledge base.

The knowledge base is represented as a dictionary where the keys are knowledge IDs and the values are the corresponding knowledge.

The `add_knowledge` method adds new knowledge to the knowledge base if the knowledge ID is unique. It returns `True` if the knowledge is successfully added, and `False` if knowledge with the same ID already exists.

The `get_knowledge` method retrieves knowledge from the knowledge base based on its knowledge ID. It returns the knowledge if it exists, and `None` otherwise.

The `update_knowledge` method updates existing knowledge in the knowledge base if the knowledge ID exists. It returns `True` if the knowledge is successfully updated, and `False` otherwise.

The `delete_knowledge` method deletes existing knowledge from the knowledge base if the knowledge ID exists. It returns `True` if the knowledge is successfully deleted, and `False` otherwise.

The `get_all_knowledge` method returns a list of tuples representing all the knowledge stored in the knowledge base, where each tuple contains the knowledge ID and its corresponding knowledge.

That completes the implementation of the LearningModule. Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!
