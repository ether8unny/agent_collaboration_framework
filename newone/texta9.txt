Certainly! Let's start by implementing the `Communications` module. This module will handle the communication between LLMs, allowing them to send and receive messages. Here's an example of how this module might look:

```python
class Communications:
    def __init__(self):
        self.message_queue = []

    def send_message(self, sender, recipient, message):
        self.message_queue.append({"sender": sender, "recipient": recipient, "message": message})

    def receive_message(self, recipient):
        received_messages = []
        for message in self.message_queue:
            if message["recipient"] == recipient:
                received_messages.append(message["message"])
        self.message_queue = [message for message in self.message_queue if message["recipient"] != recipient]
        return received_messages
```

In this example, we have a `Communications` class that has a `message_queue` attribute to store the messages. The `send_message` method allows an LLM to send a message to another LLM by providing the sender, recipient, and the message content. The message is appended to the `message_queue`.

The `receive_message` method allows an LLM to retrieve all the messages that were sent to it. It iterates through the `message_queue` and selects the messages that match the recipient LLM. The selected messages are then returned as a list. After retrieving the messages, they are removed from the `message_queue`.

With this module in place, LLMs can now communicate with each other by sending and receiving messages. We can integrate this functionality into the `main.py` script, as shown in the previous code snippet.
