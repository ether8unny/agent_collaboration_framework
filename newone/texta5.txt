Yes, the breakdown makes sense to me. Let's start by implementing the communications module.

First, we'll create a `Message` class to represent the messages exchanged between the LLMs. This class can have attributes such as `sender`, `receiver`, `content`, and `metadata`. We can also include methods for setting and getting these attributes.

```python
class Message:
    def __init__(self, sender, receiver, content, metadata=None):
        self.sender = sender
        self.receiver = receiver
        self.content = content
        self.metadata = metadata

    def set_sender(self, sender):
        self.sender = sender

    def set_receiver(self, receiver):
        self.receiver = receiver

    def set_content(self, content):
        self.content = content

    def set_metadata(self, metadata):
        self.metadata = metadata

    def get_sender(self):
        return self.sender

    def get_receiver(self):
        return self.receiver

    def get_content(self):
        return self.content

    def get_metadata(self):
        return self.metadata
```

Next, we'll create a `Communications` class that handles the sending and receiving of messages. This class can have methods such as `send_message` and `receive_message`.

```python
class Communications:
    def __init__(self):
        self.messages = []

    def send_message(self, message):
        self.messages.append(message)

    def receive_message(self, receiver):
        received_messages = []
        for message in self.messages:
            if message.get_receiver() == receiver:
                received_messages.append(message)
        return received_messages
```

With these classes, we can now send and receive messages between the LLMs. Here's an example of how we can use the communications module:

```python
# Create LLMs
llm1 = "LLM 1"
llm2 = "LLM 2"

# Instantiate communications module
communications = Communications()

# Send a message from LLM 1 to LLM 2
message1 = Message(llm1, llm2, "Hello LLM 2!")
communications.send_message(message1)

# Send a message from LLM 2 to LLM 1
message2 = Message(llm2, llm1, "Hi LLM 1!")
communications.send_message(message2)

# Receive the messages for LLM 1
received_messages = communications.receive_message(llm1)
for message in received_messages:
    print(f"Received message: {message.get_content()}")

# Receive the messages for LLM 2
received_messages = communications.receive_message(llm2)
for message in received_messages:
    print(f"Received message: {message.get_content()}")
```

This is a simple example to demonstrate the use of the communications module. In practice, we'll need to integrate this module with the other components of the framework to enable seamless communication between the LLMs.

Let's move on to implementing the task assignment and tracking module next. Do you have any ideas on how we can approach this?
