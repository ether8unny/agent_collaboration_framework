Certainly! Let's start by implementing the `communications.py` module for the Communications component. We'll create a `Communications` class that has a `send_message` method to send a message from one LLM to another LLM, and a `receive_message` method to receive messages sent to a specific LLM. Here's an example implementation:

```python
class Communications:
    def __init__(self):
        self.message_queue = []

    def send_message(self, sender, recipient, message):
        self.message_queue.append({"sender": sender, "recipient": recipient, "message": message})

    def receive_message(self, recipient):
        received_messages = []
        for message in self.message_queue:
            if message["recipient"] == recipient:
                received_messages.append(message["message"])
        self.message_queue = [message for message in self.message_queue if message["recipient"] != recipient]
        return received_messages
```

In this example, the `Communications` class has an attribute `message_queue` to store the messages. The `send_message` method takes in the sender, recipient, and message as parameters, and appends a dictionary representing the message to the `message_queue` list.

The `receive_message` method takes in the recipient as a parameter. It iterates over the `message_queue` and checks for messages with a matching recipient. If found, the message content is appended to the `received_messages` list. After retrieving the messages, they are removed from the `message_queue`. Finally, the `received_messages` list is returned.

Now, we can move forward and implement the other modules based on the outlined plan. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!
