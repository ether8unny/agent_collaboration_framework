Sure! Let's start by creating the entrypoint file, `main.py`, and then we can implement the other modules one by one. Here's an outline of the different components and modules we'll need for our collaborative framework:

1. Communications module:
   - Class: `Communications`
     - Methods:
       - `send_message(sender, recipient, message)`: sends a message from one LLM to another LLM.
       - `receive_message(recipient)`: receives messages sent to a specific LLM.

2. Task Assignment and Tracking module:
   - Class: `TaskTracker`
     - Methods:
       - `assign_task(task, llm)`: assigns a task to an LLM.
       - `get_task_status(task)`: gets the status of a task.
       - `complete_task(task)`: marks a task as completed.
       - `get_assigned_tasks(llm)`: gets the tasks assigned to a specific LLM.

3. Collaboration module:
   - Class: `Collaboration`
     - Methods:
       - `add_llm(llm)`: adds an LLM to the collaboration module.
       - `remove_llm(llm)`: removes an LLM from the collaboration module.
       - `get_collaborators()`: gets a list of all collaborating LLMs.
       - `get_collaboration_stage()`: gets the current stage of collaboration.
       - `advance_collaboration_stage()`: advances the collaboration to the next stage.

4. Information Sharing module:
   - Class: `InformationSharing`
     - Methods:
       - `share_information(sender, recipient)`: shares information between LLMs.

5. Data Warehousing module:
   - Class: `DataWarehouse`
     - Methods:
       - `store_data(data)`: stores data in the data warehouse.
       - `retrieve_data()`: retrieves data from the data warehouse.

6. Learning module:
   - Class: `Learning`
     - Methods:
       - `adapt(feedback)`: adapts the LLMs' behavior based on user feedback.

We can start by implementing the Communications module. Let me know if you have any questions before we proceed.
