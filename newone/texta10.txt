Sure! Let's start writing the code for the Communications module.

```python
class Communications:
    def __init__(self):
        self.message_queue = []

    def send_message(self, sender, recipient, message):
        self.message_queue.append({"sender": sender, "recipient": recipient, "message": message})

    def receive_message(self, recipient):
        received_messages = []
        for message in self.message_queue:
            if message["recipient"] == recipient:
                received_messages.append(message["message"])
        self.message_queue = [message for message in self.message_queue if message["recipient"] != recipient]
        return received_messages
```

This code defines the Communications class, which has an attribute `message_queue` to store the messages. The `send_message` method takes in the sender, recipient, and message as parameters and appends a dictionary representing the message to the message_queue list.

The `receive_message` method takes in the recipient as a parameter and retrieves all the messages that were sent to that recipient. It iterates over the `message_queue` and checks for messages with a matching recipient. The matching messages are appended to the `received_messages` list, and then removed from the `message_queue`. Finally, the `received_messages` list is returned.

Now, we can integrate this module into the `main.py` script. Here's an example of how we can use the Communications module:

```python
from communications import Communications

def main():
    # Instantiate the Communications module
    communications = Communications()

    # Sending a message
    sender = "LLM 1"
    recipient = "LLM 2"
    message = "Hello LLM 2!"
    communications.send_message(sender, recipient, message)

    # Receiving messages
    received_messages = communications.receive_message(recipient)
    for message in received_messages:
        print(f"Received message: {message}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this example, we import the Communications module and create an instance of it. We then use the `send_message` method to send a message from LLM 1 to LLM 2. Finally, we use the `receive_message` method to retrieve the messages sent to LLM 2 and print them.

You can now run the `main.py` script and see the output. Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else you'd like to discuss!
