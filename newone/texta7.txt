Certainly! Let's move on to implementing the collaboration module.

For the collaboration module, we can explore different methodologies, such as distributed computing or ensemble methods, to enable LLMs to collectively solve problems. This module should handle the coordination and synchronization between the LLMs, ensuring that they work in harmony and make efficient use of their collective intelligence.

Here's an example of how we can start implementing the collaboration module using a distributed computing approach:

```python
class Collaboration:
    def __init__(self):
        self.llms = []

    def add_llm(self, llm):
        self.llms.append(llm)

    def collab_solve(self, problem):
        task_results = []
      
        # Divide the problem into sub-tasks
        sub_tasks = self.divide_problem(problem)

        # Assign each sub-task to an LLM
        for i, sub_task in enumerate(sub_tasks):
            llm = self.llms[i % len(self.llms)]  # Round-robin assignment
            task_result = llm.solve(sub_task)
            task_results.append(task_result)

        # Combine the task results to get the final solution
        final_solution = self.combine_results(task_results)

        return final_solution

    def divide_problem(self, problem):
        # Divide the problem into sub-tasks
        # ...
        pass

    def combine_results(self, task_results):
        # Combine the task results to get the final solution
        # ...
        pass
```

In this example, we have a `Collaboration` class that handles the coordination of the LLMs and their collaborative problem-solving. The LLMs are represented as objects of some LLM class, which should have a `solve` method to solve a specific sub-task.

The `collab_solve` method takes in a problem as input and divides it into smaller sub-tasks using the `divide_problem` method. It then assigns each sub-task to an LLM using a round-robin assignment strategy.

Each LLM solves its assigned sub-task and returns the task result. The `combine_results` method combines the task results from all LLMs to get the final solution. The final solution is then returned by the `collab_solve` method.

Of course, this is a simplified example and you may need to adapt the implementation to fit your specific needs and use cases. You can also explore other collaboration methodologies, such as ensemble methods, to improve the collective problem-solving capabilities of the LLMs.
