Of course! Let's start implementing the code for each of the classes.

First, let's focus on the LLM class in the llm.py file. This class represents an individual Language Learning Model. We can start by implementing the constructor and the training logic.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class LLM:
    name: str
    model: str
    
    def __init__(self, name: str, model: str):
        self.name = name
        self.model = model
        
    def train(self, data):
        # TODO: Implement the training logic for the LLM
        pass
        
    def infer(self, input_data):
        # TODO: Implement the inference logic for the LLM
        pass
```

In this code, I added the `dataclass` decorator from the `dataclasses` module to automatically generate the constructor and other methods like `__repr__` and `__eq__`. This will simplify the code and make it more readable.

Next, let's move on to the CollaborationManager class in the collaboration_manager.py file. This class is responsible for managing the collaboration process between LLMs.

```python
class CollaborationManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.llms = []
        
    def register_llm(self, llm):
        self.llms.append(llm)
        
    def train_llms(self, data):
        for llm in self.llms:
            llm.train(data)
        
    def infer_llms(self, input_data):
        results = []
        for llm in self.llms:
            result = llm.infer(input_data)
            results.append(result)
        return results
```

In this code, I added the `register_llm`, `train_llms`, and `infer_llms` methods. The `register_llm` method allows us to add LLMs to the collaboration manager. The `train_llms` method iterates over all registered LLMs and calls their `train` method. The `infer_llms` method iterates over all registered LLMs and calls their `infer` method, collecting the results.

Finally, let's implement the UserInterface class in the user_interface.py file. This class handles user interactions and displays collaborative results.

```python
class UserInterface:
    def display_results(self, results):
        # TODO: Implement the method to display collaborative results to the user
        pass
        
    def get_user_input(self):
        # TODO: Implement the method to get input from the user
        pass
```

In this code, I left the `display_results` and `get_user_input` methods empty for now. We can fill them in later with the desired functionality.

Now that we have implemented the core classes with their basic functionality, we can start building upon them. Let's go back to the main.py file and add code to start the application and handle user interactions.

```python
from llm import LLM
from collaboration_manager import CollaborationManager
from user_interface import UserInterface

# Initialize necessary objects and start the application
if __name__ == "__main__":
    llm1 = LLM("LLM1", "Model1")
    llm2 = LLM("LLM2", "Model2")
    
    collaboration_manager = CollaborationManager()
    collaboration_manager.register_llm(llm1)
    collaboration_manager.register_llm(llm2)
    
    user_interface = UserInterface()

    # TODO: Add code to start the application and handle user interactions
    # ...
```

In this code, I created two LLM objects (`llm1` and `llm2`) and registered them with the collaboration manager. You can create more LLM objects if needed. Feel free to modify the names and models according to your requirements.

Now, we can start adding the code to handle user interactions and display collaborative results inside the UserInterface class.

```python
class UserInterface:
    def display_results(self, results):
        print("Collaborative Results:")
        for result in results:
            print(result)
            
    def get_user_input(self):
        return input("Enter input: ")
```

In this code, I added basic implementations for the `display_results` and `get_user_input` methods. The `display_results` method simply prints the results to the console. The `get_user_input` method uses the `input` function to get user input.

Now it's your turn! You can continue implementing the remaining parts of the classes and add more functionality as needed. Let me know if you need any further assistance or have any questions!
