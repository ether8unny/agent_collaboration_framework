Absolutely! Let's start by writing the code inside the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block in the main.py file. This code will initialize the necessary objects and handle the user interactions.

```python
from llm import LLM
from collaboration_manager import CollaborationManager
from user_interface import UserInterface

# Initialize necessary objects and start the application
if __name__ == "__main__":
    llm1 = LLM("LLM1", "Model1")
    llm2 = LLM("LLM2", "Model2")
    
    collaboration_manager = CollaborationManager()
    collaboration_manager.register_llm(llm1)
    collaboration_manager.register_llm(llm2)
    
    user_interface = UserInterface()

    # Start the application
    while True:
        # Get user input
        user_input = user_interface.get_user_input()
        
        # Train LLMs with user input
        collaboration_manager.train_llms(user_input)
        
        # Perform inference with user input
        results = collaboration_manager.infer_llms(user_input)
        
        # Display collaborative results
        user_interface.display_results(results)
```

In this code, we initialize two LLM objects (`llm1` and `llm2`) with different names and models. The collaboration manager is also initialized and the LLMs are registered with it. The user interface object is also created.

We then start the application with a while loop that keeps running until the user decides to exit. Inside the loop, we get user input using the `get_user_input` method of the user interface. We then train the LLMs with the obtained user input using the `train_llms` method of the collaboration manager.

Next, we perform inference using the trained LLMs with the obtained user input using the `infer_llms` method of the collaboration manager. The results are stored in the `results` list.

Finally, we display the collaborative results to the user using the `display_results` method of the user interface.

You can add additional functionality or modify the code based on your requirements. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!
