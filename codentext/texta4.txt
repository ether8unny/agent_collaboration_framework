Before we start writing code, let's finalize the framework, pattern, and structure of the application. This will help us ensure that we have a clear plan before diving into implementation.

Here are a few options for the framework structure that we can consider:

1. Modular Approach:
   - Core Classes:
     - LLM: Represents an individual Language Learning Model.
     - CollaborationManager: Responsible for managing the collaboration process between LLMs.
     - UserInterface: Handles user interactions and displays collaborative results.
   - Files:
     - llm.py: Contains the LLM class.
     - collaboration_manager.py: Contains the CollaborationManager class.
     - user_interface.py: Contains the UserInterface class.
     - main.py: Entry point of the application.
   - Pros: Separation of concerns, clean code organization.
   - Cons: May have overhead for setting up the collaboration process.

2. Server-Client Approach:
   - Core Classes:
     - Server: Handles the collaboration logic and communication between LLMs and clients.
     - Client: Interacts with the server and displays collaborative results.
   - Files:
     - server.py: Contains the Server class.
     - client.py: Contains the Client class.
     - llm.py: Contains the LLM class.
     - main.py: Entry point of the application.
   - Pros: Clear separation between server and client, easy scalability.
   - Cons: May introduce complexity in communication.

3. Event-Driven Approach:
   - Core Classes:
     - EventHandler: Handles events and triggers appropriate actions.
     - LLM: Represents an individual Language Learning Model.
     - UserInterface: Handles user interactions and displays collaborative results.
   - Files:
     - event_handler.py: Contains the EventHandler class.
     - llm.py: Contains the LLM class.
     - user_interface.py: Contains the UserInterface class.
     - main.py: Entry point of the application.
   - Pros: Flexibility in handling events and actions.
   - Cons: Event-driven architecture can be complex to implement.

Let's discuss these options and explore their pros and cons. Once we agree on the framework structure, we can proceed with writing the actual code.
