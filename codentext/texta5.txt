Sure, let's discuss the pros and cons of each framework structure and decide on the best approach for our project.

1. Modular Approach:
   - Pros:
     - Separation of concerns: Each class has a clear responsibility, making the codebase easier to understand and maintain.
     - Clean code organization: Having separate files for each class allows for better organization and navigation.
   - Cons:
     - Overhead for setting up collaboration process: Since the collaboration process is managed by the CollaborationManager, there might be some additional setup involved for coordinating the LLMs.

2. Server-Client Approach:
   - Pros:
     - Clear separation between server and client: This approach allows for easy scalability and separation of responsibilities between the server and the client.
     - Easy scalability: As the project grows, additional clients and servers can be added easily.
   - Cons:
     - Complexity in communication: Implementing the communication between the server and client might introduce additional complexity.

3. Event-Driven Approach:
   - Pros:
     - Flexibility in handling events and actions: Using an event-driven architecture allows for greater flexibility in handling various events and triggering appropriate actions.
   - Cons:
     - Complex to implement: Implementing an event-driven architecture can be more complex and require more careful planning.

Based on these pros and cons, I think the Modular Approach would be a good fit for our project. It provides clean code organization and separation of concerns, which will aid in understanding and maintaining the codebase.

So, let's go ahead with the Modular Approach. We'll have separate files for the LLM, CollaborationManager, UserInterface classes, and the main.py file as the entry point of the application.

Shall we start writing the code now?
