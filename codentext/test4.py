Definitely! Let's start by creating the basic structure for the framework. We can define a class for the LLMs and another class for the user interface. The LLM class would have methods for processing input and generating output, while the user interface class would handle user interactions and communication with the LLMs.

Here's an example of how the LLM class could look like:

``` python
class LLM:
    def __init__(self, model):
        self.model = model
    
    def process_input(self, input):
        # Process input using the LLM's model
        # and return the generated output
        pass
    
    def update_model(self, data):
        # Update the LLM's model using the given data
        pass
```

And here's an example of how the user interface class could look like:

``` python
class UserInterface:
    def __init__(self, llms):
        self.llms = llms
    
    def get_input(self):
        # Get input from the user
        pass
    
    def display_output(self, output):
        # Display the output to the user
        pass
    
    def start_interaction(self):
        # Start the interaction loop with the user
        # by calling get_input and display_output
        pass
```

These are just basic examples, but we can expand on them and add more functionality as we go along. What do you think? How would you like to proceed?
