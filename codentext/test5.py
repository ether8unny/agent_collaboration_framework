Absolutely! Let's start writing some code to flesh out the basic structure we discussed earlier. We can build upon the existing classes and add more functionalities to make the framework more robust.

Here's an updated version of the LLM class that includes some simple processing and model updating methods:

```python
class LLM:
    def __init__(self, model):
        self.model = model

    def process_input(self, input):
        # Process input using the LLM's model
        output = self.model.process(input)
        return output

    def update_model(self, data):
        # Update the LLM's model using the given data
        self.model.train(data)
```

And here's an improved version of the UserInterface class that includes input retrieval and output display methods:

```python
class UserInterface:
    def __init__(self, llms):
        self.llms = llms

    def get_input(self):
        # Get input from the user
        user_input = input("Enter your input: ")
        return user_input

    def display_output(self, output):
        # Display the output to the user
        print("Generated output:", output)

    def start_interaction(self):
        # Start the interaction loop with the user
        while True:
            user_input = self.get_input()
            for llm in self.llms:
                output = llm.process_input(user_input)
                self.display_output(output)
```

Of course, these are still basic implementations, and we can enhance them further. For example, we can introduce error handling and input validation in the UserInterface class, and more advanced processing and training mechanisms in the LLM class.

What specific functionalities would you like to add or modify? Let's continue building upon this code base together!
