Absolutely! Let's start writing the code for the classes and functions that we outlined earlier. We'll begin with the `LLM` class in the llm.py file.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class LLM:
    name: str
    model: str

    def __init__(self, name: str, model: str):
        self.name = name
        self.model = model

    def train(self, data):
        # TODO: Implement the training logic for the LLM
        pass

    def infer(self, input_data):
        # TODO: Implement the inference logic for the LLM
        pass
```

In this code, we defined the `LLM` class as a dataclass. We included dataclass from the `dataclasses` module in Python to simplify the creation of the class. The `LLM` class has two attributes, `name` and `model`, which are initialized in the constructor.

We also added the `train` and `infer` methods, which are placeholders for the actual training and inference logic. We will implement these methods later.

Next, let's implement the `CollaborationManager` class in the collaboration_manager.py file.

```python
class CollaborationManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.llms = []

    def register_llm(self, llm):
        self.llms.append(llm)

    def train_llms(self, data):
        for llm in self.llms:
            llm.train(data)

    def infer_llms(self, input_data):
        results = []
        for llm in self.llms:
            result = llm.infer(input_data)
            results.append(result)
        return results
```

In this code, we defined the `CollaborationManager` class. It has an attribute `llms` which is a list to store the registered LLM objects.

The `register_llm` method takes an LLM object as input and adds it to the `llms` list.

The `train_llms` method iterates over all registered LLMs and calls their `train` method with the provided data.

The `infer_llms` method iterates over all registered LLMs and calls their `infer` method with the given input data, collecting the results and returning them as a list.

Next, let's implement the `UserInterface` class in the user_interface.py file.

```python
class UserInterface:
    def display_results(self, results):
        print("Collaborative Results:")
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    def get_user_input(self):
        return input("Enter input: ")
```

In this code, we defined the `UserInterface` class. It has a `display_results` method that takes a list of results as input and prints them to the console.

The `get_user_input` method uses the `input` function to get user input and returns it.

Now we have written the code for the core classes. We can add the necessary functionality in the main.py file to start the application and handle user interactions.

```python
from llm import LLM
from collaboration_manager import CollaborationManager
from user_interface import UserInterface

# Initialize necessary objects and start the application
if __name__ == "__main__":
    llm1 = LLM("LLM1", "Model1")
    llm2 = LLM("LLM2", "Model2")
    
    collaboration_manager = CollaborationManager()
    collaboration_manager.register_llm(llm1)
    collaboration_manager.register_llm(llm2)
    
    user_interface = UserInterface()

    # Start the application
    while True:
        # Get user input
        user_input = user_interface.get_user_input()
        
        # Train LLMs with user input
        collaboration_manager.train_llms(user_input)
        
        # Perform inference with user input
        results = collaboration_manager.infer_llms(user_input)
        
        # Display collaborative results
        user_interface.display_results(results)
```

In the main.py file, we import the `LLM`, `CollaborationManager`, and `UserInterface` classes. We then create two LLM objects, register them with the collaboration manager, and create a user interface object.

Inside the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block, we start the application with a while loop that continues until the user decides to exit. In each iteration, we get user input, train the LLMs with the input, perform inference using the LLMs, and display the results to the user.

Feel free to modify the code and add more functionality based on your requirements. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!
