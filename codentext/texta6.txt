Great! Let's start writing the code. 

To begin with, we can create the main.py file, which will serve as the entry point of our application. This file will import the necessary classes and functions from other files and initialize the necessary objects.

In main.py, we can start by importing the LLM, CollaborationManager, and UserInterface classes. We'll also import any additional modules or libraries that we might need.

```python
from llm import LLM
from collaboration_manager import CollaborationManager
from user_interface import UserInterface

# Initialize necessary objects and start the application
if __name__ == "__main__":
    llm = LLM()
    collaboration_manager = CollaborationManager()
    user_interface = UserInterface()

    # TODO: Add code to start the application and handle user interactions
    # ...
```

Next, let's move on to creating the LLM class in the llm.py file. This class will be responsible for representing an individual Language Learning Model.

```python
class LLM:
    def __init__(self):
        # TODO: Implement the constructor for the LLM class
        pass
        
    def train(self, data):
        # TODO: Implement the training logic for the LLM
        pass
        
    def infer(self, input_data):
        # TODO: Implement the inference logic for the LLM
        pass
```

In the LLM class, we have placeholders for the constructor, training logic, and inference logic. We'll need to fill in the details later on.

Moving on, let's create the CollaborationManager class in the collaboration_manager.py file. This class will be responsible for managing the collaboration process between LLMs.

```python
class CollaborationManager:
    def __init__(self):
        # TODO: Implement the constructor for the CollaborationManager class
        pass
        
    def collaborate(self, llms):
        # TODO: Implement the collaboration logic between the LLMs
        pass
```

In the CollaborationManager class, we have placeholders for the constructor and collaboration logic. We'll need to define these methods later on.

Finally, let's create the UserInterface class in the user_interface.py file. This class will handle user interactions and display collaborative results.

```python
class UserInterface:
    def __init__(self):
        # TODO: Implement the constructor for the UserInterface class
        pass
        
    def display_results(self, results):
        # TODO: Implement the method to display collaborative results to the user
        pass
        
    def get_user_input(self):
        # TODO: Implement the method to get input from the user
        pass
```

Similarly, in the UserInterface class, we have placeholders for the constructor, method to display results, and method to get user input. We'll need to define these methods later on.

These are the initial outlines for the core classes in the modular approach. Now, we can start adding the actual code inside the methods to implement the desired functionality.

Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything specific you'd like to start implementing first!
