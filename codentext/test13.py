Sure! Let's continue writing code to enhance the collaborative framework. 

One functionality we can add is the ability for LLMs to vote on the suggestions generated by other LLMs. This can help prioritize the suggestions and determine which ones are more relevant or preferred.

To implement this functionality, we can modify the start_interaction() method in the UserInterface class to include a voting process. Here's an updated version of the code:

```python
class UserInterface:
    def __init__(self, llms):
        self.llms = llms

    def get_input(self):
        # Get input from the user
        user_input = input("Enter your input: ")
        return user_input

    def display_output(self, output):
        # Display the output to the user
        print("Generated output:", output)

    def display_suggestions(self, suggestions):
        # Display the suggestions to the user
        print("Suggestions:")
        for suggestion in suggestions:
            print("- " + suggestion)

    def get_user_feedback(self):
        # Get feedback from the user
        feedback = input("Enter your feedback: ")
        return feedback

    def validate_input(self, input):
        # Validate user input
        if not input:
            raise ValueError("Input cannot be empty")

    def start_interaction(self):
        # Start the interaction loop with the user
        while True:
            user_input = self.get_input()
            try:
                self.validate_input(user_input)
                for llm in self.llms:
                    output = llm.process_input(user_input)
                    self.display_output(output)
                    feedback = self.get_user_feedback()
                    llm.update_model(feedback)  # Adjust LLM's behavior based on feedback

                suggestions = []
                for llm in self.llms:
                    generated_suggestions = llm.generate_suggestions()
                    suggestions.extend(generated_suggestions)
                    shared_suggestions = []
                    for other_llm in self.llms:
                        if other_llm != llm:
                            other_llm.share_suggestions(generated_suggestions)
                            shared_suggestions.extend(other_llm.get_shared_suggestions())
                    suggestions.extend(shared_suggestions)

                self.display_suggestions(suggestions)

                # Voting process
                votes = []
                for suggestion in suggestions:
                    vote_count = 0
                    for llm in self.llms:
                        vote = llm.vote_on_suggestion(suggestion)
                        vote_count += vote
                    votes.append((suggestion, vote_count))

                # Sort suggestions based on vote count
                suggestions = [suggestion for suggestion, _ in sorted(votes, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)]

                self.display_suggestions(suggestions)

                option = input("Do you want to save or load model state? (save/load/none): ")
                if option == "save":
                    filepath = input("Enter the file path to save model state to: ")
                    for llm in self.llms:
                        llm.save_model(filepath)
                elif option == "load":
                    filepath = input("Enter the file path to load model state from: ")
                    for llm in self.llms:
                        llm.load_model(filepath)

            except ValueError as ve:
                print(f"Invalid input: {str(ve)}")
```

In this updated code, after displaying suggestions to the user, we add a voting process. Each LLM votes on the suggestions generated by the other LLMs using the `vote_on_suggestion()` method. The votes are then counted for each suggestion and stored in a list.

Next, we sort the suggestions based on the vote count in descending order. The suggestions with the highest number of votes will be displayed first.

By incorporating the voting process, we can prioritize the suggestions based on the collective decision of the LLMs. This can help improve the quality of the suggestions presented to the user.

Let's continue building upon this code base and add more functionalities! What would you like to work on next?
