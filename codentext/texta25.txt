Certainly! Let's proceed with implementing the main logic in the `main.py` file. Here's the updated code:

```python
from llm import LLM
from collaboration_manager import CollaborationManager
from user_interface import UserInterface

# Create instances of the classes
llm1 = LLM("LLM1", "Model1")
llm2 = LLM("LLM2", "Model2")

collaboration_manager = CollaborationManager()
collaboration_manager.register_llm(llm1)
collaboration_manager.register_llm(llm2)

user_interface = UserInterface()

while True:
    # Get user input
    user_input = user_interface.get_user_input()

    # Train LLMs
    collaboration_manager.train_llms(user_input)

    # Infer using LLMs
    results = collaboration_manager.infer_llms(user_input)

    # Display results
    user_interface.display_results(results)
```

In this code, we create instances of the `LLM`, `CollaborationManager`, and `UserInterface` classes. We register the LLM instances with the collaboration manager. Then, we enter an infinite loop where we prompt the user for input, train the LLMs with the user input, perform inference using the trained LLMs, and display the results to the user. The loop continues until the program is terminated externally.

Now, when you run the `main.py` file, it will repeatedly prompt you for input, train the LLMs, perform inference, and display the results. You can customize the behavior of the LLMs, collaboration manager, and user interface as needed to fit your specific requirements.
