Certainly! Let's continue writing code to enhance our collaborative framework.

One functionality we can add is the ability for LLMs to communicate with each other through messages. This can be useful for LLMs to exchange information or coordinate their actions.

To implement this functionality, we can extend the CollaborativeLLM class and add methods for sending and receiving messages:

```python
class CollaborativeLLM(LLM):
    def __init__(self, model):
        super().__init__(model)
        self.shared_data = []
        self.messages = []

    def share_data(self, data):
        # Share data with other LLMs
        self.shared_data.append(data)

    def get_shared_data(self):
        # Get the shared data from other LLMs
        return self.shared_data

    def send_message(self, message):
        # Send a message to other LLMs
        self.messages.append(message)

    def receive_messages(self):
        # Get the received messages from other LLMs
        return self.messages
```

In the CollaborativeLLM class, we add the send_message() method to append the message to the `messages` list. We also add the receive_messages() method to retrieve the received messages.

Now, let's update the UserInterface class to incorporate the sending and receiving of messages between LLMs:

```python
class UserInterface:
    def __init__(self, llms):
        self.llms = llms

    def get_input(self):
        # Get input from the user
        user_input = input("Enter your input: ")
        return user_input

    def display_output(self, output):
        # Display the output to the user
        print("Generated output:", output)

    def display_suggestions(self, suggestions):
        # Display the suggestions to the user
        print("Suggestions:")
        for suggestion in suggestions:
            print("- " + suggestion)

    def get_user_feedback(self):
        # Get feedback from the user
        feedback = input("Enter your feedback: ")
        return feedback

    def validate_input(self, input):
        # Validate user input
        if not input:
            raise ValueError("Input cannot be empty")

    def start_interaction(self):
        # Start the interaction loop with the user
        while True:
            user_input = self.get_input()
            try:
                self.validate_input(user_input)
                suggestions = []
                for llm in self.llms:
                    output = llm.process_input(user_input)
                    self.display_output(output)
                    feedback = self.get_user_feedback()
                    llm.update_model(feedback)  # Adjust LLM's behavior based on feedback
                    suggestions.extend(llm.generate_suggestions())
                    shared_data = llm.get_shared_data()
                    for other_llm in self.llms:
                        if other_llm != llm:
                            other_llm.share_data(shared_data)
                            other_llm.send_message(f"Shared data from LLM {llm}")
                    received_messages = llm.receive_messages()
                    for message in received_messages:
                        print(f"Received message: {message}")
                self.display_suggestions(suggestions)

                option = input("Do you want to save or load model state? (save/load/none): ")
                if option == "save":
                    filepath = input("Enter the file path to save model state to: ")
                    for llm in self.llms:
                        llm.save_model(filepath)
                elif option == "load":
                    filepath = input("Enter the file path to load model state from: ")
                    for llm in self.llms:
                        llm.load_model(filepath)

            except ValueError as ve:
                print(f"Invalid input: {str(ve)}")
```

In the start_interaction() method of the UserInterface class, after generating suggestions, each LLM instance shares its data and sends a message to the other LLMs. We iterate through the other LLMs and exclude the current LLM to avoid sharing data and messages with itself.

Moreover, we add a loop to check for received messages from other LLMs and print them out.

By enabling communication between LLMs, they can exchange information and coordinate their actions, leading to more collaborative and cooperative behavior.

Let's continue building upon this code and add more functionalities to our collaborative framework! What would you like to work on next?
